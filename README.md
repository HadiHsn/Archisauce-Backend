# Archisauce-Backend
This is a Node JS based project, fit for a startup company/service.

How to use?
you need to have Node JS installed on your pc.
Then you have to run "npm install" in the terminal.
Finally, after the "node_modules" folder is successfully installed, you have to run "node server.js" command and start enjoying our project.

Thank you
